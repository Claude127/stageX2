Seen my teens flew by in a coach seat
Since we all grown up, you tryna show me
What you tryna do now, huh
You played me once before, now you feel like you want me
Back when I took off, I'm a trophy
Back when I wasn't nothin', you was a trophy

Oh (No, no, no, no), yeah, yeah, yeah
Get it through your mind
Asked for all this time
