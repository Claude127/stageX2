Ooh, ooh, whoa
Ooh-whoa
Oh, no
Rich sex
Brand new
Tesla
I'm feeling brand new (you gotta let me)
I like stunting on my friends, when I watch
And the doors come up like my legs
In the middle of the night on the gram
And I'm flexing for life
I know I be on some crazy shit (yeah)
But I love to, love to feel so weak in the knees
Oh, like SWV
I love it raining on me
I love it when you touching on me
It's like water, oh, no, don't drown
Oh, like SWV
I like sexing in the backseat
(You) I got (got) seven days to make your knees weak
I'll hit it right tonight (hit it right)
To make sure that you don't leave me (you wouldn't leave me)
You-you-you know
You wouldn't leave me
You-you-you know
You wouldn't leave me (yeah, mm)
What kind of love is it that you're channeling? (Ooh)
I'm hurting, this her thing, she could have it
Obsessed with the pussy causing havoc
Am I the first one tonight to throw you backwards? (Ooh)
Spread your legs, grab your head until your back hurts (back hurts)
Doing oral things, do it right then, let's do that first
And you told me what he did and I know that hurts
And I know you love him, but I'm bringing you closer (oh, oh)
With my tongue inside and things get hot, closer (oh, oh)
And you far right now, pulling up to my spot like, closer (oh, oh)
T-touching you up and feeling your thighs like, closer (oh, oh)
Once I give you this dick, I'ma ruin your life, oh (oh)
Oh, like SWV
I like sexing in the backseat
(You) I got (got) seven days to make your knees weak
I'll hit it right tonight (hit it right)
To make sure that you don't leave me (you wouldn't leave me)
